# Functional Reactive Programming (FRP)
A reference implementation for client and server functional reactive programming concepts. FRP is a style of writing software which both obeys functional rules and treats event streams as king. Since time is the 4th dimension within which we live, it makes sense to develop with time as a first class citizen. This repo is about collecting the best in class components to create any app in the FRP style. In some cases, FRP either doesn't apply or isn't practical. These cases will be explicitly called out.

- ExpressJS
- GraphQL with subscriptions
- Kafka Streams
- Tensorflow (RNN, Attention networks?)

## Client
- CycleJS
- CycleJS State
- Mobile first (PWA, Service workers)
- Offline first (PouchDB?)

## Continuous Deployment
- Docker
- Kubernetes in production
- Minikube in dev
- Travis or Circle CI
